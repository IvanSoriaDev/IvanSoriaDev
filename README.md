Senior .NET Fullstack & Mobile Engineer specializing in building scalable web, mobile, and microservice-based systems. I work across ASP.NET Core, EF Core, .NET MAUI/Xamarin, Angular/React, SQL, and Azure (App Services, Functions, Service Bus, Key Vault, API Management, Application Insights, AKS) with Docker and CI/CD pipelines. I design solutions using Clean/Onion Architecture, SOLID, CQRS/MediatR, and proven design patterns (Repository, Unit of Work, Dependency Injection, Factory), and I’m comfortable with event-driven architectures using RabbitMQ/Kafka and strong testing practices (xUnit/NUnit, Moq).
